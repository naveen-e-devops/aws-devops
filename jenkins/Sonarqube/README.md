SonarQube is a popular open-source tool used for continuous code quality inspection and analysis. It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs in source code.

SonarQube can analyze various programming languages including Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more. The tool can be integrated with various CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, GitLab CI, and others.

The analysis of code quality in SonarQube is performed based on various criteria, such as the complexity of the code, the presence of duplicate code, code coverage, and adherence to coding standards. The tool provides a detailed report on the code quality issues and provides suggestions on how to improve the code quality.

Using SonarQube in the development process can help in detecting and fixing code quality issues early in the development cycle, which can reduce technical debt and improve the overall quality of the software.
